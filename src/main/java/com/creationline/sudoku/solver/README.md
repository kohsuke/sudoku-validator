My overall approach

- Build proper building blocks
  - To deal with complex problems, like solving sudoku, by using those, which leads to simplicity
  - To guide the future improvements to the code in a better direction
  - To allow comprehension one piece at a time
- 9x9 puzzle is so small, constant time performance overhead doesn't matter
